Valkr Web Crawler, Go Version
---

Status: failing build.
Observation: While a Go microservice may be recommended for the crawling
of webpages for filling the Valkr search engine dataset in the Postgresql
database. This does not seem to be as simplified as something with more
controls such as a Ruby on Rails application or NextJS application may
offer.

Conclusion for MVP Viability:
I have taken the time to attempt to build a MVP for this microservice.
In seeing that the Go microservice will make it more difficult to easily
control the parameters surrounding a web crawler and the data attached
to the Valkr search engine itself, I will not be pursuing Go any longer
as a contender for an initial MVP. It does not have the ability to provide
long term, fine grained, visual access to controls, data found, and to
become a worthwhile product that saves money while obtaining meaningful
search engine results for the Valkr search engine service.

Notes:
I may revisit this option after getting the service off of the ground
with an MVP, but as I am only one person working on this project,
generally, when a particular set of technologies are chosen to 
accomplish a task, they are chosen to work and then be iterated upon
without looking back for fast turnovers of feature and income generating
activities. At present, Go has failed to fulfill a much needed value
proposition in short order on a small, starter scale.
